OCCRA-2012-Team43-Goll-Roll
===========================

This is OCCRA Team 43, the Holly/Grand Blanc Knights, robot code for the 2012 Oakland County Competitive Robotics Association game, Goal Roll. The Holly Knights graciously invited the EngiNERDs to participate in OCCRA with them this year.

OCCRA uses the IFI Vex Cortex microcontroller; our code was written for the EasyC V4 IDE for the Cortex.

Robot and code featurses:

-Six wheel drive, a center drop of roughly 1/8", middle and rear plaction wheels with FRC KoP front wheels, driven by four CIMs.
-Arcade drive code, inspired by FRC 254 and built upon FRC/VRC/OCCRA 33.

-Two hooks on the same axle to grab and manipulate roller goals, driven by a DeWalt drill motor.
-Two routines: one designed for forward and backward, the other for manual joystick control.
